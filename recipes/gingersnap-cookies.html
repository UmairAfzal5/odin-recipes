    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These gingersnap cookies will melt in your mouth. I received this ginger cookie recipe from my grandmother; it's been enjoyed in my family since 1899.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gorund ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark molasses</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cinnamon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until blended, then sift a second time into another bowl.</li>
        <li>Place shortening in a mixing bowl and beat until creamy. Gradually mix in white sugar. Beat in egg and dark molasses until light and fluffy. Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the shortening mixture; stir to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour mixture and mix together until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them into 1-inch-diameter balls between your hands. Roll each ball in cinnamon sugar, then place 2-inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
